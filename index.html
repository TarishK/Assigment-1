					<h1>Personal Information</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My name is Tarish Kapur, I’ve been living in Australia most of my life and am of Indian descent. The first 4 years of my schooling was conducted in India with the rest of the education done in Brisbane. After high school, I was given reigns of the family business which I successfully ran by myself for 5 years up until May 2022.I have since then taken a few months off, found myself a new job and have enrolled in this course. Small fun fact about me is that when I was 16, I had aspired to become a graphics designer, so I taught myself how to use Photoshop, cinema 4d and other editing programs with the help of YouTube. I’ve always had an interest in technology due to having a curiosity on how things work and my beginner’s mindset when approaching a task is something I believe is best fit for the IT profession.</p>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>IT, or information technology, is the use of computers and other technology to manage and process information. This can include a wide range of activities, such as storing, retrieving, and manipulating data, as well as more development tasks like programming, networking, and security. The main reason I chose IT is that it gives me the opportunity to learn something new every day.</p>
					<p>Working closely with the IT & security department in my workplace is originally what sparked my interest and is how I found out about this course. Technology is ever evolving and so are the threats that come with it toward our security. Staying current with this and stopping bad actors is my main end goal for me. My main intention with this course is to enhance my knowledge to point where I have a better understanding of how technology is used in all different fields and operation and learn how to protect it.</p>

				<h1>Ideal Job</h1>

					<h2>Security Analyst</h2>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>The position above is for a Security analyst role in cooperation. This role is a very technical role and is something that is appealing to me, due to the nature of the work and having the ability to set out and maintain a security infostructure of a whole business or organization.</p>
					<p>There are a multitude of prerequisites set out for almost all security analyst vacancies. This can include Industry standard certifications such as CISSP, CISA and CISM to list a few. The role also requires proven experience for some time in a dedicated security environment, a strong understanding of Windows, UNIX, and Linux Operation Systems and most importantly a well profound knowledge of risk &security standards and prevention protocols.</p>
					<p>As of current, I do not meet any of the formal criteria required to be to be considered for the role except finishing a small security course in the past through LinkedIn and having a general knowledge of the windows operating system.</p>
					<p>Moving forward, the long-term plan to obtain the qualification is to work on finishing this IT degree through RMIT while incrementally also adding industry-specific certifications to my resume. In the short term, I will be looking to pin-point what best pathway would be and pick the right institution to attain the industry specific certification due to there being so many. A few that have already caught my eye are the security blue team 1 junior analyst certification and CompTia + certification.</p>

				<h1>Personality Profile</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator -Consuls</h2>
					<p>The Myres-briggs test depict that I have a consul’s personality, a positive individual who encourages, lifts and strengths other. An empathetic person with a good understanding of others’ emotions and tend to build good connections with others. This being the standout strength as such attributes are needed when building/ working in a team. Another strength that was highlighted here was that a consul has a strong sense of duty to meet any obligation. This attribute fundamentally shows that in a team environment I am more than willing to meet the expectation put forth by the group. Some more strengths to note here would strong practical skills for example management of day-to-day tasks and routines. As well as being loyal all lead to indicate that a consuls personality tends to flourish in a group environment.</p>
					<h3>Weakness</h3>
					<p>Weaknesses to point out here would the unwillingness to step out of my comfort zone. In a group environment from time to time you are set or given a task that you may not be comfortable with and there are times individuals must compromise. Another weakness that was highlighted here was the consuls are vulnerable to criticism although I can relate to this at some level, in a group constructive criticism is needed because without it a group or an individual cannot develop. The weaknesses here will be evaluated and considered when working in a group because failing to do so can and will cause friction in between the team.</p>
					<h3>Team Composition</h3>
					<p>The results here will play a key part in my behaviour in a team. In the case that the team has no direction or is lacking execution on a certain topic, I will be happy to recourse the team and as a collective, we can all provide ideas and direction where possible. The result does show that I am very comfortable with working in a group and the ability to make someone feel heard and take on ideas is one of my strengths.  More importantly, when asked or assigned set task that I am unfamiliar with, I will consult my group and ask for help where necessary as well as try to conduct as much background information on the set topic while also trying to tackle the task at hand. The weaknesses here help me determine how I can better work alongside a group and work in an efficient manner as well as be a team player.</p>

					<h2>Test Two</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Learning Preferences</p>
					<p>The learning style is that of a hands-on learner which I can agree with. I prefer to engage myself in activities-based learning rather than the more traditional textbook learning.</p>

					<h2>Test Three</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Leadership Style</p>
					<p>Lastly, the leadership style is something I can relate to when looking back at my past experiences of running a business. Front-line leadership is something that I practiced daily when working in the hospitality industry and understood the core value of focusing on your people.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>The project idea that I am proposing is a google chrome extension that can be downloaded from the google extension store this extension will work similarly to a scam detector website. The extension will run in the background and deliver the end user with a trust score where 0 is the worst rating and 100 is the best for any website. The extension can be utilised to determine if an individual should continue using the set platform by and can be used by anyone who chooses to browse the web securely. The main purpose behind this idea is to mitigate the risk of a user getting scammed by a malicious website.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>The main motivation behind this project in fact came from a close family friend who was a victim of an online investment scam. As per the Australian competition & consumer commission (ACCC) Australians have lost more than $1.8 billion in 2021 to scams with true costs being over $2 billion if we consider all the victims that have not officially reported. With Investment scams are the most popular and online shopping scams rating the 7th highest. This chrome extension may not facilitate savings of billions of dollars however having a tool like this readily available is a step in the right directing to provide reassurance to the end user in the case that they are speculating on the legitimacy of a certain platform.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>The extension will be user-friendly with a very basic but sleek UI for version 1 the extension will run in the background when the user loads into a new website, like an ad blocker. On the back end, the fundamentals of this extension are based on an API that will be sourced by Apivoid and or a scam adviser. Firstly, the API that is being used will take the domain name and will run checks against domain name blacklist servers. This will help identify potentially malicious and fraudulent websites involved in fake online shopping, malware distribution, and data phishing incidents. In addition, the API will run a WHOIS background check to establish when the set domain was created, any nameservers assigned to the domain, and any domain registrants. All the details complied together will determine the trust score of the website which is then communicated with the software and provided to the end user through the chrome extension.</p>
					<p>For convenience, the user does not need to click an additional button or copy and paste the domain name anywhere. The script will be made as a background script to run once the user loads into the set website if the extension is enabled. It will then extract the domain name and feed it into the software which will then provide a trust score. The extension will not prompt the end user if the trust score is equal to or than 80% however, it will provide a small number icon next to the icon badge of the extension to let the user know that their trust score is ready if needed. In the case that the trust score is below 80% the extension will prompt the user with the “trust score + “please review” message. From here on the user can determine if they wish to continue with the website or choose to leave by pressing “leave site” on the UI.</p>
					<p>When the user decided to hover above icon badge, they see the UI. The UI itself will be sleek with a light space grey background. At the top it will present the name of the extension “Scoreit” underneath in the middle, trust score of the website will be displayed and at the bottom 2 buttons “Stop extension” “New score”. Both buttons essentially do the exact things they state. On the left the “New score” will run the diagnose of the website again and on the right the “Stop extension” will halt the extension until turned back on by pressing the same button.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>The main tools utilised to create this extension will be Atom for the Javascript, HTML & CSS files. This tool including the Google chrome developer’s mode will be the main applications used to write the code and execute when completed. API will also be sourced from a third-party provider who specialises in the scam detection industry. The way that the data from API is delivered will also need to be taken into consideration when making the UI. Bootstrap can also be utilised here when creating the front-end interface.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>Understanding and having a knowledge of CSS, JavaScript and HTML will be paramount to bringing this extension to fruition. Code needs to be written in order to execute the background script as well as to fetch the data from the API. An understanding of HTML & CSS will be viable as it falls in line with the course structure for Essentials of IT. As JavaScript is not a language that every first year IT student has experience with, this is something that the group can outsource from a contractor or alternatively use a step-by-step guide on how on to create a google extension using Java. Although we are taking the very traditional route of creating the code ourselves there are alternative tools that can be used at our discretion if the task is not feasible, such as the chrome extension builder from nocodehq.</p>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>If the project is successful, it will fulfill its end purpose of helping an individual deem legitimacy of a website and moderate the number of users falling victim to online scams while also saving their hard-earned money. With cyber scams on a rise, such a development that is readily available to the consumers with a few clicks will bring some reassurance to the end user that browsing the web can be done in a safe manner without having to be concerned about bad actors.</p>
